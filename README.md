# About
CommandsPlus (Commands+) is an open-source plugin made by 2 Israeli developers, to help make better quality plugins, with readable functionality, small usable API, and a continuous updating schedule to make sure it'll fit in a good spot specifically for every Spigot/Paper server.

# Distribution
This plugin is completely open-source, and we're happy for anyone to take on a fork/join our team to make better competitive marketing for free software plugins!
as of now, we're not looking to make the plugin a premium software plugin or anything to do with purchasing the rights to own a copy, therefor we're licensing via MIT protocol for professional causes.

# Compiling
As of now we're using standard IDE compiler, we're planning on moving the plugin into Gradle and start using the default Gradle-Wrapper Builder.
By default our project uses Lombok & SpigotAPI, but that's about it for now.

## Building
If you're using Eclipse, simply right-click on the project, click export, and make sure to export the plugin with the YML files.

For IntelliJ users, use the default IntelliJ [exportation system](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/import-project-or-module-wizard.html).
